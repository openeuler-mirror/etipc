#### Installation

These instructions assume that your system is running Linux kernel 2.6.16(or later),and that you are already familiar with the steps involved in rebuilding a "vanilla" Linux kernel from source provided at www.kernel.org
    1.Copy etipc-1.7.7*.tar to the top level directory of the kernel source tree
    2.Install the TIPC source files into the kernel source tree.
	eg. tar -xvf etipc-1.7.7*.tar
    3.Configure the kernel to include TIPC, either statically or as a loadable module.
	eg. make menuconfig
    4.Rebuild and install the kernel in the normal manner
	eg. make
      If you are building etipc as a loadable module,build net/tipc/tipc.ko and install it in the standard manner.
    5.Boot up your system,then build the tipc-config tool and use it to configure and manage TIPC
	eg. cd <tipc-config source directory>
            make
	    ./tipc-config <commands>
