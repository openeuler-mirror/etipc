tipc-config for Linux README
       
Last updated: 01 October 2008


This directory contains the configuration tool used with Linux TIPC.


Building the tool
-----------------
For a TIPC 1.6 (or later) installation, just do a normal build; the tool's
makefile should locate the necessary TIPC include files automatically.

eg. cd <tipc-config directory>
    make


If the TIPC include files are not properly located, find the directory that
contains the files linux/tipc.h and linux/tipc_config.h and specify this
directory in the make command:

eg. cd <tipc-config directory>
    make INCLUDE_PATH=<path to directory containing linux/tipc.h>

Note: In the standard Linux kernel source tree, this directory is located
at <top of source tree>/include.


The build procedure produces a "tipc-config" exectuable.


Additional rules:

1) make clean		- deletes the tipc-config executables


Running the tool
----------------
Details of the commands provided by tipc-config can be found in the TIPC 1.7
User's Guide (http://tipc.sourceforge.net/doc/tipc_1.7_users_guide.html).
